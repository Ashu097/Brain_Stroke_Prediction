# Brain_Stroke_Prediction
A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds, or when thereâ€™s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain.
The Major insights of the project are the following-
Taken the data set of patients for brain stroke.
Used different plots to analyze the data.
Used Oversampling to handle an imbalanced data set.
Training different ML models to predict Brain stroke.
Used different models to analyze the data.
Taken stroke as the target variable. 
Based on the data set Age and BMI have the highest positive correlation.
